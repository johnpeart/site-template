This is a template post for use in the `site-template` repository.

It stores all the core files that I might use to quickly scaffold a new site. Using this template repository means that the site will automatically be styled in the same format as the rest of my sites. 

The template includes:

- header (`_data/header-menu.csv` and footer (`_data/footer-menu.csv`) menu files; these are not required but if used they will override the defaults
- a template post in the `_posts` folder
- a sass override file (`_sass/_override.scss`)
- default site images (`assets/images/site/*` and `/favicon.ico`), which should be overriden for each site deployed
- a default Github workflow (`.github/workflows/jekyll-deploy.yml`) that will deploy the site using Jekyll and Github Actions; note that you need to set the repository secret on Github before this will work
- a default `Gemfile`; you will need to override the Gemfile settings as appropriate and then use `bundle install` to generate the `Gemfile.lock`
- a default `.gitignore` to ignore various files generated by Jekyll automatically
- Nova set up files for the local IDE I prefer to use

You will want to add a `CNAME` file if you are using a subdomain for the site. This is a plain-text file with a single line for the URL, without the preceding `https://` or `http://`.
